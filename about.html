	<!--<p>Hello and welcome.<br>
	My name is Amber Anderson, a digital illustrator located in Orange County, California.<br><br>
	Most robust and focused in digital illustration, hence the purpose of this online portfolio. Currently using Affinity suite software for this endeavor, after transitioning from pre-cloud Adobe software.<br><br>
	Also experienced with other areas of graphic design, most notably web and print.<br>
	Current examples of web design work includes building/maintaining this website utilizing just HTML/CSS, and hosting on GitHub. I also built and maintain an ecommerce website for my chainmaille jewelry at <a href="https://www.neondragonmaille.com" target="_blank">Neon Dragon Maille</a>. Currently hosted on BigCartel, though previously via WordPress. I also create all the content for these websites, including graphics and print elements, alongside all photography and photo editing.
